aeroDefault
================
Default Thunderbird 'aero' theme for older Windows XP.

Use default theme from 'aero' Windows in older versions (XP or 2000). Not intended for Windows 7 or Vista.

aeroDefault is no longer maintained due to low number of its users. If you are interested to take it over, don't hesitate to get in touch with me or just fork this repo.

Previous releases you can find on [AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/aerodefault/versions/).
